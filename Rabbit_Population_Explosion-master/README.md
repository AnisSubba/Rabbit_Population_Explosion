# Rabbit Population Explosion
We are going to build a rabbit population programme.
Considerations:

Phase 1 - Rabbits
* Each second will represent a month
* Breeding rabbits reach maturity at 3 months
* The programme will start with a single breeding pair
* If a male is available a female can be pregant and give birth in one month
* Each breeding pair can create between 1-14 offspring that can be a random male or female
* A female that has given birth can breed again immediately after giving birth
* Rabbits day at 5 years
